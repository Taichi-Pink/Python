# WDR Face Database Project

The official codebase for [WDR Face](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03826.pdf). To facilitate and support future face detection research in the WDR field, we propose the first WDR database for face detection. This dataset contains a total of 398 16-bit megapixel grayscale wide dynamic range images collected from 29 subjects. These WDR images (WDRIs) were taken in eight specific WDR scenes. The dynamic range of 90% images surpasses 60,000:1, and that of 70% images exceeds 65,000:1.  If you need access to this dataset, please contact the authors.
